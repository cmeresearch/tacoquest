# Salsa Huevona

* Poblano pepper
* Tomatoes
* Onions
* Garlic
* Cilantro
* Lime Juice
* Salt

Roast the pepper, tomatoes, and sliced onions on a grill until nicely scorched, turning periodically to cook evenly. Peel blackened husk off of pepper, remove seed pod and stem, then chop all roasted ingredients. Combine in a mortar and pestle or bowl. Add in chopped cilantro, minced garlic, a splash of lime juice, and salt. Mix together all ingredients, checking taste and altering quantities as needed.
