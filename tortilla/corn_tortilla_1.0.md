# Corn Tortilla
* 1 lb fresh masa dough or 1.5 cups masa harina kneaded with 1 cup water
* 1 tortilla press
* 2 pieces of wax paper

Make sure the dough is soft enough to be pressed without forming cracks. If it is to dry, add some water and knead.

Set up a cast iron pan to  medium high heat, and another to low medium heat.

Roll the masa into spheres roughly the size of a golf ball.

Using two wax paper sheets on either side of the masa, press the dough balls one at a time with the tortilla press until they are around 5 inches in diameter.

One at a time, cook each tortilla on the cooler pan for around 15  seconds, then flip it onto the hotter pan for an additional 30 seconds. Then flip it over on the hotter pan for an additional 10 seconds. The dough may inflate slightly. Do not panic, this is normal.

If the dough is too dry, the edges will begin to crack. Add more water if necessary. Once all tortillas are done, store in an insulated container until ready to serve.
