# Cider Lime Chicken

* 1tbs Adobo Seasoning
* 2tsp Turmeric
* 1tsp Salt
* 1/2 Poblano Pepper, roughly chopped
* Small bunch of Cilantro

* 1 bottle Strongbow Gold Apple Cider
* 1/4 cup Lime Juice

Marinated for ~45min. Prep pan with other half of pepper, then cook until chicken is done. Serve with a fresh, bright salsa.

Notes: Good flavor, but too subtle; couldn't overcome the salsa and cheese to stand out. Chicken by itself was quite good, though. Maybe try again with milder salsa and some changes to the recipe to make the chicken stronger. Different cider or pepper might help.
