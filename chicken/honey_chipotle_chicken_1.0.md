# Honey-Chipotle Chicken

* 1tsp Ground Coriander
* 1tsp Chipotle Chili Powder
* 1tsp Paprika
* 1tsp Salt

* 1tsp Mongolian Fire Oil
* 1-2tbs Honey
* ~1/2cup White Cooking Wine

* Cubed or Chopped Chicken Breast

Coat chicken in mixture. Cook on medium-high heat until chicken is cooked through and most of the mixture in the pan has evaporated.

_Notes:_ This recipe was tried on a small scale with a single boneless skinless chicken breast. 1tsp of Mongolian Fire Oil was used, had a very pleasant warm heat but may be too spicy for some. Depending on desired spiciness and amount of chicken, more or less may be advisable. In future, may try marinating overnight to see if there is a difference in taste. Overall good amount of sweetness with a really slow, pleasant kick of spice.
