# Concept File

A list of ideas for new recipes, or modifications to existing recipes

**New Recipes**
* Cider lime chicken
* Mushroom (Portobello, Cremini, or Shiitake?)
* Breaded Baja fish (Maybe start with SortedFood's or Rick Bayless's recipes, then develop from there)

**Modifications and Future Directions**
* Experiment with dried chiles like ancho or guajillo
* Add MSG to vegetarian/vegan recipes to improve richness
