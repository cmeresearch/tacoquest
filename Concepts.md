A list of ideas for new recipes, or modifications to existing recipes

**New Recipes**

_Meats/Vegetables_
* Cider lime chicken
* Grilled portobello
* Breaded Baja fish (Inspiration from SortedFood's or Rick Bayless's recipes, then develop from there)
* Beer-battered fish (How to make this more interesting? What to add other than beer?)
* Moroccan-inspired slow-cooked meat and fruit

_Salsas_
* Salsa Verde
* Salsa Huevona

**Modifications and Future Directions**

* Experiment with dried chiles like ancho or guajillo
* Add MSG to vegetarian/vegan recipes to improve richness
