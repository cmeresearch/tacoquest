# Bourbon Fish Tacos

* 1tsp Dried Cilantro
* 1tsp Ground Coriander Seed
* 1tsp Smoked Paprika
* 1tsp Adobo Seasoning
* 2tsp Chipotle Chili Powder
* 1tsp Salt

* 1tsp Ginger Paste
* 1tbs Lime Juice
* 1/2cup Bourbon Whiskey

* White fish with firm flesh such as cod, mahi, halibut, etc.

Marinate for several hours or overnight. When ready to cook, prep pan by roasting chopped green onion and a halved red chili pepper in it for a few minutes, until the pepper is blackened. Take fish fillets out of marinade and cook at medium-high heat until done. 
Serve with a fresh salsa, possibly with some sweetness to it (e.g. with mango or sweet peppers).
