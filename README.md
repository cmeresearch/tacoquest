_A quest to develop the perfect taco recipe_

Just click on one of the folders for the kind of taco you want to make, then click on the specific recipe. If you have a taco, salsa, or tortilla recipe you'd like to contribute, please do so!

Each recipe has a descriptive name and a version number. Versioning is from 0.0 to 1.0 exclusive if recipe is not yet to the point where it's good, 1.0 and up for revisions of a successful recipe. Variants are designated with letters, e.g. Bourbon_Fish_1.0a would be the first variant of Bourbon_Fish_1.0
