A quest to develop the perfect taco recipe

Each recipe has a descriptive name and a version number. Versioning is from 0.0 to 1.0 exclusive if recipe is not yet to the point where it's good, 1.0 and up for revisions of a successful recipe. Variants are designated with letters, e.g. Bourbon_Fish_1.0a.
