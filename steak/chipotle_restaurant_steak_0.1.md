# Chipotle (Restaurant) Steak

* 2oz ancho chiles
* 1/2 red onion, quartered
* 6 cloves garlic
* 2tbs fresh oregano, chopped
* 2tsp cumin
* 1tsp black pepper
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil

* Skirt steak or similar

Tear off chile stems, split open chiles, and remove seeds. Toast for a few seconds in a pan on medium heat, pressing down; or in shallow oil. Toast garlic until black spots start to develop. Then soak chiles for 20-30 minutes in hot water. Put all marinade ingredients into a blender and puree til smooth. Coat meat in marinade and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.

Grill steak in a hot pan or on a hot grill until done. Let rest under tin foil for a few minutes before slicing.

**Notes:** This is an experiment with using dried chiles. I'm starting with the official steak recipe from the Chipotle restaurant since I'm familiar with how that tastes and I like the flavor. This will allow single-ingredient alterations in the future, such as substituting guajillos for anchos.
