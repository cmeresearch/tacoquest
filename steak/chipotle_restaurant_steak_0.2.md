# Chipotle (Restaurant) Steak

* 2 ancho chiles
* 2 New Mexico dried chiles
* 1/2 red onion, quartered
* 6 cloves garlic
* 2tbs fresh oregano, chopped
* 2tsp cumin
* 1tsp black pepper
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1tsp salt

* Skirt steak or similar

Tear off chile stems, split open chiles, and remove seeds. Toast for a few seconds in a pan on medium heat. Toast garlic until black spots start to develop and garlic is soft. Then soak chiles for 20-30 minutes in hot water. Put all marinade ingredients into a blender and puree til smooth. Coat meat in marinade and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.

Grill steak on a hot grill until done. Let rest under tin foil for a few minutes before slicing.

**Notes:** Pretty disappointing. Part of the problem is that I overcooked the meat, but even without that the flavor just wasn't great. Certainly not worth the effort involved in preparing the marinade. The cumin overpowered everything, which just reinforces my belief that cumin should be used very sparingly. Its flavor is just too intense if used in quantity. I think before I try advancing this concept further I should experiment with marinades, tasting as I go, until I develop something that tastes good all by itself.
