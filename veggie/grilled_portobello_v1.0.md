# Grilled Portobello Mushroom Tacos

* Portobello Mushrooms (About 1-2 per person)
* 1 Ancho chile
* 2 Dried New Mexico chiles or Chipotle chiles
* 1tsp Minced Garlic
* 1tsp Garlic powder
* 2tsp salt
* 1tsp cooking amino acids or MSG (Helps give richness and body to the mushrooms)
* Lime Juice
* Olive il or Canola oil

Take the chiles and remove the stems, seeds, seed pods, and veins to desired spiciness. Roast in a skillet until blistered all over, aromatic, and slightly crisped. Break into pieces and put into a blender with the garlic, garlic powder, salt, and amino acids/MSG. While blending, add oil and juice in a roughly 5:1 ratio until there is enough volume to coat the mushrooms. Blend to a fine consistency, ensuring that there are no chunks of garlic or chile. Remove mushroom stems, then brush mushrooms with marinade and allow to marinate for some time (30mins-2hrs). Grill until cooked throughout, erring on the side of overcooking because a little char gives depth of flavor. Serve with queso fresco and a warm, rich salsa like salsa huevona.
